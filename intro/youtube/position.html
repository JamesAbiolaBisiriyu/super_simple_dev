<body style="height: 3000px; margin-top: 55px;">

<div style="background-color: black; color: white;
position: fixed; top: 0px; right: 0; left: 0; height: 50px;">

<!-- position fixed fixes the header to the page and doesnt scroll along with page 
the TOP attribute keeps the header fixed at the top based on amount of pixel applied So left tells us how much space is between the element and the left edge of the. So we can set this in all four directions we've seen top left. We can also set bottom. And right now a special feature of these properties is that if we set it in opposite directions, the element will stretch.

So for example, if we set it to left, and so these two are opposite directions and we set the right to 50 pixels, notice that the element stretches. So now this element is 50 pixels from the left of the page right here, and it is also 50 pixels from the right of the page. So it will stretch the element to meet these two conditions.-->
