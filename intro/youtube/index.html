    <!-- DIV is a container that groups other elements together so that we can create complex layouts, eventually our YouTube project. -->
    <!-- So what is the nested layouts technique? The basic idea is that there are two types of layouts. The first one is a vertical layout, 
      where items are on top of each other. And then the second one is a horizontal layout, where items are beside each other. 
      And by using a combination of vertical and horizontal layouts, we can create almost anything that we see on a website. -->

        So this is going to be our vertical layout. 
        Now remember that divs are block elements by default, so they're going to take up the entire line and appear one on top of another. -->

           An inline block element only takes up as much space as it needs to and doesn't take up the entire line.
           An example of an inline block element is the image element and the input element. -->
