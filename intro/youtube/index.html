    <!--  A block element takes up the entire line. So a PARAGRAPH by default is a block element.  -->
    <!-- The second type of element is an inline block element.
       An inline block element only takes up as much space as it needs to and doesn't take up the entire line.
       An example of an inline block element is the image element and the input element. -->
    <!-- The third type of basic HTML element is called the inline element. Inline elements are basically just text elements. 
      They appear within a line of text. e.g the element STRONG. -->
